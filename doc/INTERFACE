= Wiimote Interface =

This is the documentation of the kernel interface to the wiimote. If you use the
xwiimote library, you do not need to know this, however, if you plan to write an
XINPUT driver or similar and don't want to use this library, read below.

A wiimote, when connected to the system, will show up as:
	/sys/bus/hid/devices/<deviceID>
<deviceID> is a unique id which will never be used twice. To monitor for new
devices, you can simply place an inotify on /sys/bus/hid/devices or use libudev.

Notice: When this directory shows up, you need to wait a short time until
everything below this directory is set up. If you use libudev, it will notify
you, when the device is fully setup. A short sleep of 10ms should be enough,
though.

To work with a wiimote, there are actually two APIs. Input events are reported
through an input device. The subdirectory of each device:
	./input/inputX/
contains information about the input device. Udev will automatically set up:
	/dev/input/eventY
for each wiimote. However, if you run without udev, you need to create your own
device node with "mknod". Major and minor number are available in:
	./input/inputX/dev
The name of the eventY file that is created by udev is actually the same as:
	./input/inputX/eventY
However, its only the same name, not the same file! Also inputX and eventY have
different suffixes. The X of inputX increases systemwide and is never reused,
whereas eventY may reuse free numbers which are no longer used.

This input device is used to report input events. Please see INTERFACE_INPUT for
information about what data is reported.

The input interface can not be used to control the wiimote, though. It only
reports information. To change the wiimote status, you must use the other files
in the sysfs directry. All of them are placed directly in:
	/sys/bus/hid/devices/<deviceID>
and can be accessed from a shell. See INTERFACE_SYSFS for information about
these files. They allow to change the LEDs, control the rumble motor, enable or
disable the accelerometer and IR and much more.

Last but not least, there are some debugfs files. These are only for debugging
wiimotes and shall not be used in applications. If debugfs is mounted as:
	/sys/kernel/debug
then you may access it via:
	/sys/kernel/debug/hid/<device>/
It will contains several files to access the wiimote. Be sure NOT TO WRITE to
them files if you don't know what they do. For instance, writing to the "eeprom"
file allows to overwrite the internal EEPROM memory of the wiimote.
