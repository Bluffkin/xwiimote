Date:		July 2011
Contact:	David Herrmann <dh.herrmann@googlemail.com>
Description:	Make it possible to set/get current led state. Reading from it
		returns 0 if led is off and 1 if it is on. Writing 0 to it
		disables the led, writing 1 enables it.

Description:	Reading this returns 0 if the accelerometer is currently turned
		off and 1 if it is turned on. Writing 1 to it enables the
		accelerometer and 0 disables it.

What:		/sys/bus/hid/drivers/wiimote/<dev>/ir
Date:		July 2011
Contact:	David Herrmann <dh.herrmann@googlemail.com>
Description:	Make it possible to set the IR camera into different states.
		Writing "off" to it turns off the IR camera. Writing "basic"
		turns the IR cam into basic report mode. Writing "extended"
		puts the cam into extended report mode and "full" puts it into
		full report mode.
		When reading also one of these values is returned.
		The modes differ in the amount of information they return. All
		of them return 10 bits of precision per object. The extended
		and full mode also return object sizes.
		Only the full mode returns intensity values and bounding boxes.

What:		/sys/bus/hid/drivers/wiimote/<dev>/input/<inputX>/
Date:		July 2011

Description:	This is the evdev interface of the wiimote. It can be used to
		get access to the /dev/input/eventY interface. See evdev API
		for further access information.
		See INTERFACE_INPUT for information on the data that is reported
		via this input interface.
