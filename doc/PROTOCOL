= Nintendo Wii Remote Protocol =
The wiimote communicates via standard bluetooth technology
with the host. This document is divided into two parts. The
first part described the low-level bluetooth connection that
is established between the host and the wiimote with
pairing support. The second part is about the protocol that
is used to communicate with the wiimote.

  == Bluetooth Connection ==
  The wiimote can be in the following states:
    off: The wiimote power is turned off and no interactions
         are possible.
    discoverable: The wiimote is not connected to any host but
         put into bluetooth discoverable mode. Furthermore, it
         is possible to establish a new bluetooth baseband
         connection to the wiimote.
    connecting: The wiimote is currently establishing a connection
         with a host or vice versa.
    connected: The wiimote is currently connected to a host.

    === Discoverable State ===
    The wiimote is built around a Broadcom bluetooth chip that
    can be placed into discoverable mode in two ways:
     1: Pressing the red sync-button behind the battery-cover
        on the back of the wiimote. This will place the wiimote
        directly into discoverable mode for exactly 20 seconds
        and then turn the wiimote off again.
     2: Holding down the 1 and 2 buttons on the front of the
        wiimote will put the wiimote into discoverable mode.
        First, the wiimote performs auto-reconnect and if that
        fails it goes into discoverable mode. If the buttons
        are held down continuously, the wiimote will stay in
        discoverable mode, otherwise it turns off after 20
        seconds.
    When in discoverable mode, the wiimote is seen as:
      "Nintendo RVL-CNT-01"
    For all later references in this document, we assume the
    wiimote has the following bluetooth address:
      "00:1E:35:3B:7E:6D"
    The binary representation of BD-addresses is in reversed order
    so this would be the six byte array:
      0x6d 0x7e 0x3b 0x35 0x1e 0x00
    When in discoverable mode, a host may establish a new bluetooth
    baseband connection to the wiimote. Every host is allowed to do
    that. No encryption nor pairing is required.

    When in discoverable mode, all four LEDs on the wiimote will
    blink when the battery is full. With lower battery status, less
    LEDs will blink. If the battery is nearly empty, only the left
    most LED blinks.

    === Connecting State ===
    There are two ways to establish a connection with a wiimote:
     1: Initiate a baseband connection to the wiimote while the
        wiimote is in discoverable state.
     2: Let the wiimote auto-reconnect to your host.

      ==== Initiating a Connection ====
      When the wiimote is in discoverable state, any bluetooth host
      can create a new baseband BR/EDR bluetooth connection to the
      wiimote. There are no special considerations or non-standard
      procedures.
      However, optionally, you may initiate pairing with the wiimote.
      This is not required and may be skipped, though,
      auto-reconnection can only be used when the host is paired
      with the wiimote.

      Pairing can be initiated by sending an HCI authentication request.
      The bluetooth stack will require a PIN for legacy pairing. This
      PIN depends on the method used to put the wiimote into
      discoverable mode. If method (1) was used (that means, the red
      sync button was pressed) then the PIN is the bluetooth address
      of the host in binary form (that is reversed order). If the buttons
      1+2 were used (that is method (2)), then the PIN is the address
      of the wiimote in binary form. In our case this would be the 6-byte
      array:
        0x6d 0x7e 0x3b 0x35 0x1e 0x00
      When pairing is done, all further connections may use the new
      link-key instead of PIN-requests, but this should be handled by
      the bluetooth stack automatically.

      When the wiimote is paired with a host with method (1) (And only
      with this method! That is, red sync button!) then the wiimote
      will save the bluetooth address of the host for further reference
      so it can automatically reconnect to the host on disconnection.

      ==== Auto-Reconnection ====
      The wiimote maintains a list of bluetooth addresses of hosts that
      it was connected to and paired with. If any single button on the
      wiimote is pressed while it is turned off, the wiimote turns on
      and tries to connect to one of the hosts in this list. It tries
      only once so you may need to press a single button multiple times
      to get connected to a host.
      It is currently impossible to control which host is tried first.
      Moreover, it is unknown how many addresses the wiimote can save
      so it may take many times (5 times, 10 times or even more) until
      the wiimote connects to an available host. If more than one host
      is available, it is not possible to predict what host the wiimote
      connects to.
      However, it seems that the wiimote maintains an internal sorted
      list of hosts and if it successfully connects to a host, this host
      is put on top of this list and hence tried first next time.

      When using auto-reconnection, no pairing is required and pairing
      does not provide any more functionality here.

      ==== SDP Information ====
      When a low-level connection is established, you may query the SDP
      server of the xwiimote which returns a great deal of information:
       * Name: "Nintendo RVL-CNT-01"
       * PnP: VendorID: 0x057e ProductID: 0x0306
      And a lot more PnP, SDP and HID related information.

    When the low-level baseband connection is established, the l2cap
    channels can be opened. On auto-reconnection, the wiimote will connect
    to the host (that is, the host must listen on the l2cap channels).
    If the connection is initiated by the host, then the wiimote listens
    for incoming connections on the l2cap channels.
    Two l2cap channels are used for communication:
     * Channel PSM 0x11 for sending data to the Wiimote
     * Channel PXM 0x13 for receiving data from the Wiimote
    Both must be opened for communication with the wiimote.
    No further steps are required to setup the connection with the wiimote.
    The wiimote is considered to be in "connected" state now.

The following list contains protocol details which where not
investigated and are still unknown:
  * What happens if two hosts try to connect to the wiimote?
  * Does the Wiimote implement the BT HID profile or just use
    HID commands via an l2cap channel?
  * How many host can be saved for auto-reconnection on the
    wiimote?
  * How to manage the list of auto-reconnection hosts?
  * How to reset the wiimote?
  * Is pairing possible when using auto-reconnection? Which key to use?
