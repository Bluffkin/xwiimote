	Wiimote Input Interface (evdev)

The wiimote registers input interfaces that are accessible via evdev for every
connected wiimote device. See INTERFACE_SYSFS on information how to get the
right /dev/input/eventX devices.

Don't open devices that you do not need. Otherwise power-management cannot work
correctly. For instance: The wiimote's IR camera is only enabled if someone is
currently reading the input event device for the IR cam. If no-one has an open
file-descriptor to it, the wiimote's IR cam is turned off to save energy.
Also do not open devices just to read the device names. Use sysfs to retrieve
the correct event device and then only open this device.
If an event device is opened the first time, complex initialization sequences
are sent to the wiimote. They do not harm the wiimote but cost lots of energy so
try to open only the devices you need.

The input devices can be matched by name. The following devices are available:
	- "Nintendo Wii Remote"
		Wiimote core key events are reported here and also
		force-feedback support is available.
		Button Events:
		Button events are reported as EV_KEY events. The following
		mappings from wiimote buttons to KEY_* flags are used:
		Button:  Flag:
		 UP       KEY_UP
		 DOWN     KEY_DOWN
		 LEFT     KEY_LEFT
		 RIGHT    KEY_RIGHT
		 A        BTN_A
		 B        BTN_B
		 MINUS    KEY_PREVIOUS
		 PLUS     KEY_NEXT
		 HOME     BTN_MODE
		 ONE      BTN_1
		 TWO      BTN_2
		Key-repeat events are also generated by the input layer.

		Force-Feedback support is available via FF_RUMBLE or compatible
		flags. It is only one single motor that can be turned on and
		off.

	- "Nintendo Wii Remote Accelerometer"
		This input device is used to report accelerometer data.
		The wiimote accelerometer reports 3 axis accelerometer data as
		EV_ABS values via: ABS_RX, ABS_RY and ABS_RZ
		Maximum value of each is 500, minimum is -500.

	- "Nintendo Wii Remote IR"
		Reading this device will report IR events. The IR Cam can track
		up to 4 dots and reports absolute positions for each dot. It
		reports them via ABS_HAT0X/Y to ABS_HAT3X/Y.

	- "Nintendo Wii Remote Motion+"
		If a motion+ adapter is attached, this device will appear. You
		can read ABS_RX, ABS_RY and ABS_RZ values which represent the
		gyro-sensor values.

	- "Nintendo Wii Remote Extension"
		If an extension is attached, you can read extension events from
		this device. Depending on the connected extension, the received
		values may differ.
