.SH NAME
xwiishow \- Test connected Wii Remote devices

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xwiishow [/sys/path/to/device]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B xwiishow
tool, when called without arguments, lists all connected Wii Remotes. The paths
that are listed can be passed as argument to the tool and it will open the
device and print an ASCII-image to the console representing the Wii Remote. If
you press a key on the device, the tool will notify you by highlighting the
related parts of the image.

In the ncurses-based interface you can press 'q' to quit the application, 'r' to
toggle the rumble motor and 'a' to toggle the accelerometer.

.SH EXAMPLES
.B $ xwiishow

No device path given. Listing devices:

  Found device: /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.1/usb3/3-2/3-2:1.0/bluetooth/hci0/hci0:11/0005:057E:0306.0001
.br
End of device list

.B $ xwiishow /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.1/usb3/3-2/3-2:1.0/bluetooth/hci0/hci0:11/0005:057E:0306.0001
.br
<ncurses based interface>

.SH BUGS
This tool is quite incomplete. It does not support all interfaces that are
provided by the wiimote kernel driver. However, it provides enough functionality
to test whether a Wii Remote is detected properly.

The tool reads the input devices directly so you might need root rights to
properly access the Wii Remote.
