Thank you for using this driver!

== Install ==

To install the libxwiimote.so library and the related tools, use:
	$ ./configure [--enable-debug] [--prefix=/usr]
	$ make
	$ make install
If "configure" is not available, use:
	$ ./autogen.sh

Dependencies:
	- libudev: Used for device enumeration
	- ncurses: Used for UI of xwiishow

This software packages contains:
	libxwiimote.so: A userspace library which helps accessing connected Wii
		Remotes in the system. It can be used by applications to use Wii
		Remotes as input. You can also use the direct kernel interface,
		though.
	xwiishow: A test application which lists all connected Wii Remotes. If a
		Wii Remote is passed as argument, it continuously reads input
		from the device and prints it to the screen.
	50-xorg-disable-wiimote.conf: X configuration file which should be
		installed into /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/ by your distribution. It
		adds all Wii Remotes to the input blacklist of the X-server.
		This is needed since the raw Wii Remote kernel interface is
		useless (even irritating) to the X-server. Instead the
		emulators should be used.
	xwiikeymap: The most basic emulator. It reads input from a Wii Remote,
		maps it to other configured keys and feeds it as input into the
		system. This allows to remap the Wii Remote buttons to your
		needs and have it as input to the X-server or similar. This is
		only for the buttons and has no accelerometer, IR, etc. support.

The following tools are available but not installed into the system:
	xwiidump: A test application which reads the EEPROM memory of a
		connected Wii Remote and prints it to stdout. This requires
		debugfs support in the kernel and hid-wiimote kernel module.

Following software is not part of this package:
	hid-wiimote.ko: The wiimote kernel module is available in the official
		linux kernel sources and should already be installed in your
		system if you run a kernel linux-3.1 or newer.
		The ./driver/ directory contains a copy of the driver but you
		should instead rely on the in-kernel driver.
	wiimote.so: The BlueZ bluetoothd wiimote plugin is part of the upstream
		BlueZ package and available since bluez-4.96. It should be
		already installed on your system.

== Usage ==

The XWiimote software stack is split into 3 parts:
	- BlueZ: The official linux bluetooth stack (BlueZ) needs a few patches
		to allow pairing with Wii Remotes. These patches are part of
		BlueZ since bluez-4.96. They are available as plugin wiimote.so,
		which needs to be enabled during configuration with:
			./configure --enable-wiimote
		Most distribution should already contain the plugin.

		With this plugin you should be able to pair your Wii Remote like
		any other bluetooth device. If this plugin is not available, you
		need to connect to the device without pairing/bonding. Simply
		select "Connect without authentication/pairing/bonding" or
		"Use no PIN" during connection.
		The Wii Remote can be put into discoverable mode by pressing the
		red sync-button behind the battery cover on the back of the Wii
		Remote. You can also put it into discoverable mode by holding
		the 1+2 buttons simultaneously. However, the red-sync button
		works more reliably and auto-reconnect is not available when the
		1+2 buttons are used.

		This plugin is responsible for pairing Wii Remotes. It does not
		provide any input from the peripheral. This is done by the
		kernel driver.
	- Kernel: The linux kernel includes an hid-wiimote.ko plugin since
		version linux-3.1. The related config option is
		CONFIG_HID_WIIMOTE. It is available in the configuration under:
			"Linux Kernel/Device Drivers/HID/HID Drivers"
		With linux-3.1 only basic LED and button input is available.
		With linux-3.2 accelerometer, IR and rumble support is added.
		With linux-3.3 extension and debug support is added.
		If the kernel driver is loaded and a Wii Remote is connected via
		BlueZ, the driver automatically takes control over the Wii
		Remote and provides a kernel interface to user-space. The
		libxwiimote.so library can be used to access this interface. You
		may also access it directly. Read ./doc/INTERFACE for a
		description of the kernel interface. It is recommended to use
		the library, though.
		The kernel interface hides the protocol details but still
		provides very general access to the Wii Remote. This interface
		is not suitable to be used as direct application input. Instead
		several emulators exist which emulate a mouse or keyboard based
		on the kernel interface. This is needed because there are
		several different ways to interpret the input and use the Wii
		Remote as input device. We do not want to limit it to a single
		mode so you need to use an emulator to get proper input.
		Applications may choose to use the libxwiimote.so library,
		though, if they want direct access to the Wii Remote and the
		emulators are not sufficient. See ./doc/LIBRARY for the library
		interface.
	- Userspace: The userspace part (aside from BlueZ) consists of a library
		called libxwiimote.so to access the Wii Remotes directly and
		several emulators which provide emulated mouse/keyboard input to
		the system based on the raw kernel interface.
		Applications should ignore the kernel input devices from Wii
		Remotes as they provide only raw data. Instead an emulator
		should be started which provides a separate input device which
		can be accessed by the X-server or other applications and
		provides basic mouse and keyboard input.

To use Wii Remotes you always need the BlueZ wiimote plugin and the
hid-wiimote.ko kernel driver. Both are part of the upstream repositories of the
linux kernel and the BlueZ project and automatically built in the distributions.

For testing purposes it is recommended to use the xwiishow tool. It has an
ncurses based user-interface and is the most straightforward way to test whether
the Wii Remote works on your machine.
For more sophisticated tasks you should read the documentation of the emulators
or the libxwiimote.so library depending on your needs.

Happy Playing!
