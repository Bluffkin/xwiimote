Thank you for using this driver!

== Usage ==

This distribution contains only the userspace helper libraries and tools. The
actual kernel driver is part of the official linux kernel since version 3.1. The
upstream kernel does not always include the latest release of the kernel driver,
so you may choose to remove the driver from your kernel and compile a more
recent one.
If wou want to compile your own module, please read ./driver/Makefile or just
try:
	cd ./driver
	make
This should create the hid-wiimote.ko module. This distribution contains a copy
of the last stable release of the driver inside ./driver/hid-wiimote.c. It is
recommended that you download the most recent one from the xwiimote_kernel
repository instead of using this one.

If you have your module loaded (either from your upstream kernel or your own
compiled one) the following directory should exist:
	ls /sys/module/hid_wiimote
If it does, you have loaded the module successfully (or it is compiled
statically into your kernel).

To connect a wiimote, you need at least bluez-4.96. Older bluetooth versions
will only work if you do NOT pair your wiimote, but simply connect without
pairing/bonding. Be sure your bluez does contain the "wiimote" module. It is
part of the official distribution but may be disabled by your operating system
distribution.
You can connect your wiimote just like any other bluetooth device and it should
work out of the box. If you don't want to reconnect your wiimote manually every
time, you can use "auto-reconnect":
You need to pair your wiimote with your PC by pressing the red "sync"-button on
the back of the wiimote under the battery cover (Pressing 1+2 buttons DOES NOT
WORK). It is important that you PAIR with the wiimote. A simple connect will not
work. After that, the wiimote should reconnect to your PC if you press any
button.

Happy Playing!

== Install ==

The wiimote kernel module is shipped with linux kernel version 3.1 or higher so
it should be already installed on your system. If not, please see USAGE
information above.
To install the userspace libraries or tools, read below.

This distribution contains a library to access connected wiimotes. This library
is not needed at all to use wiimotes in your own application, though, it eases
the task. To use wiimotes without this library, see ./doc/INTERFACE for
documentation.

To install this library, you need libudev installed on your system. Then do:
	make build
to build "libxwiimote.so". You may want to install this shared library in your
system with:
	cp libxwiimote.so /usr/lib/
	cp lib/xwiimote.h /usr/include
There is currently no "make install". Please use your distributions package
manager or copy them manually as shown above.
Please see ./doc/LIBRARY for usage information of the library.

To install the tools, run "make" inside the tools directory. Please read each
source file to get information on those tools.

== Development ==

Please see ./DEV for development information.

== Copying ==

This whole distribution is dedicated to the Public Domain. Please see ./COPYING
for more information.
