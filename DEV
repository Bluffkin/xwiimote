== Kernel Driver ==

The kernel driver repository "xwiimote_kernel" is a fork linus' linux git tree.
There are several branches which reflect different states of development:
 - stable: This branch is the current stable tree of the driver. Since the
   driver is included in upstream kernel, this is mostly a copy of the stable
   tree from git.kernel.org.
 - testing: This is based on "stable" but contains additional features which are
   considered to be stable but not tested enough. Feel free to build this
   tree and test the new features.
 - master: This is current HEAD of development. It contains unstable and
   untested code so use it at your own risk.

All branches are rebased when "stable" changes so do not pull them into your
tree or you may get unexpected results. Instead, rebase your tree on this one.
Additional branches may be available which test different approaches for a
feature and are not considered to be used for productive environment. Use them
at your own risk.
